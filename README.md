# Nero for Supreme
Nero is an automated checkout tool for Supreme New York, helping users buy limited-release clothing faster than anybody else.

Well, it did. This bot was developed in Fall 2018, and is severely outdated (and a manifestation of terrible coding practices from my early days). Certain non-essential features were not implemented into this open-source version.

Nero was built using the Electron framework. This bot **will not check out** anymore due to changes in Supreme's API, uploaded only as a look into how the requests were formed and verified when checking out products on Supreme's web store during the FW18 season.

## Usage
Fixes were made before upload to patch memory leaks and deprecation warnings. Use `npm start` to start the bot after installing all dependencies with `npm install`.
