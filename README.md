Nero is an automated checkout tool for Supreme New York, helping users buy limited-release clothing faster than anybody else.

Well, it did. This bot was developed in Fall 2018, and is severely outdated (and a manifestation of terrible coding practices from my early days).

Nero was built using the Electron framework. This bot **will not work at all** anymore, uploaded only as a look into how the requests were formed and verified when checking out products on Supreme's web store during the FW18 season.

Fixes were made before upload to patch memory leaks and deprecation warnings. Use `npm init` to start the bot after installing all dependencies.
